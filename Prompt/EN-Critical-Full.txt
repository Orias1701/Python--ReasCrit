You are an expert tasked with evaluating the reasoning trace used to generate a summary from a source text. Carefully read the source document, the reasoning trace, and the generated summary. Assess the reasoning based on the six criteria below:
1. Factuality
•	Evaluate how accurately the reasoning reflects the information in the original document, using the following steps:
•	Step 1: Read the entire reasoning trace and source document.
Step 2: Compare each idea in the reasoning with the source to identify any misinformation, misinterpretation, or hallucination.
Step 3: Highlight incorrect or unsupported content.
Step 4: Provide detailed comments, with specific examples if available.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on factual accuracy:
•	1: Contains many serious factual errors or completely misrepresents the source.
•	2: Contains several factual errors that significantly affect interpretation.
•	3: Minor factual issues, but the overall meaning aligns with the source.
•	4: Almost entirely accurate, with only negligible mistakes.
•	5: Fully accurate with no factual errors.

2. Clarity
•	Evaluate how clear and comprehensible the reasoning is:
•	Step 1: Read the reasoning and assess the structure and language.
Step 2: Identify ambiguous or unclear parts or where ideas are not clearly separated.
Step 3: Check the organization and coherence between steps.
Step 4: Provide detailed comments, with examples if needed.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on clarity:
•	1: Incoherent and difficult to understand; lacks structure.
•	2: Several unclear or under-explained segments.
•	3: Generally clear, but contains confusing or ambiguous portions.
•	4: Well-written with good flow; only minor issues.
•	5: Very clear and easy to follow; excellent structure and expression.

3. Logical Coherence
•	Evaluate the logical progression and consistency across reasoning steps:
•	Step 1: Analyze the sequence and logical relationships between reasoning steps.
Step 2: Identify any missing connections or internal contradictions.
Step 3: Assess the overall coherence and logical soundness.
Step 4: Provide detailed observations with examples.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on logical coherence:
•	1: No clear logical structure; steps are disconnected.
•	2: Multiple logical gaps or inconsistencies.
•	3: Somewhat coherent, but contains weak or unclear transitions.
•	4: Mostly coherent; minor logical flaws.
•	5: Fully coherent and logically structured throughout.

4. Coverage
•	Evaluate how well the reasoning captures the key points of the original document:
•	Step 1: Identify the main ideas of the source document.
Step 2: Check whether the reasoning includes all key information.
Step 3: Note any important omissions or redundancy.
Step 4: Provide specific comments or examples where applicable.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on coverage:
•	1: Misses many critical ideas.
•	2: Misses a significant portion of the core content.
•	3: Omits a few important points.
•	4: Covers almost all key points, with minor gaps.
•	5: Thoroughly covers all essential information.

5. Utility
•	Evaluate how useful the reasoning is in helping understand how the summary was constructed:
•	Step 1: Assess whether the reasoning explains why each point was kept or omitted.
Step 2: Determine how well it supports traceability of the summarization process.
Step 3: Provide clear comments and examples if available.
Step 4: Indicate if the reasoning lacks any helpful function.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on utility:
•	1: Provides no insight into the summarization process.
•	2: Offers minimal support and lacks explanation.
•	3: Partially helpful in understanding the reasoning.
•	4: Clearly useful and aids traceability.
•	5: Highly useful; offers full transparency of the summarization process.

6. Consistency
•	Evaluate how well the summary aligns with the reasoning trace. The summary should accurately reflect the ideas retained in the reasoning and not introduce unmentioned content.
•	Step 1: Compare the key ideas in the reasoning with those in the summary.
Step 2: Check whether the summary fully includes the points kept in the reasoning.
Step 3: Verify that the summary does not introduce ideas that were not mentioned in the reasoning.
Step 4: Provide detailed comments, citing examples if applicable.
Step 5: Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on consistency:
•	1: Completely inconsistent; the summary does not reflect the reasoning at all.
•	2: Largely inconsistent; very few overlaps between summary and reasoning.
•	3: Moderately consistent, but some key points are missing or extra ideas are introduced.
•	4: Mostly consistent with minor issues.
•	5: Fully consistent; the summary accurately and completely reflects the reasoning.
