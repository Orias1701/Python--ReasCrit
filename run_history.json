    "feedback": "The summary is factually accurate, clear, and coherent. It effectively covers the main points of the original text, including the authors shortlisted, the prize details, and the eligibility criteria. The reasoning trace is well-structured and provides a logical flow of information. The summary is consistent with the reasoning trace and offers a concise overview of the topic. To further improve the summary, consider adding a sentence about the inaugural nature of the prize and its purpose in response to criticisms of the Booker Prize's previous exclusivity."
